# NAME
kubelet \- Processes a container manifest so the containers are launched according to how they are described.

# SYNOPSIS
**kubelet** [OPTIONS]

# DESCRIPTION

The **kubernetes** kubelet runs on each node. The Kubelet works in terms of a container manifest. A container manifest is a YAML or JSON file that describes a pod. The Kubelet takes a set of manifests that are provided in various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those manifests are started and continue running.

There are 3 ways that a container manifest can be provided to the Kubelet:

    File: Path passed as a flag on the command line. This file is rechecked every 20 seconds (configurable with a flag).
    HTTP endpoint: HTTP endpoint passed as a parameter on the command line. This endpoint is checked every 20 seconds (also configurable with a flag).
    HTTP server: The kubelet can also listen for HTTP and respond to a simple API (underspec'd currently) to submit a new manifest.
