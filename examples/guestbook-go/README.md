## GuestBook example

This example shows how to build a simple multi-tier web application using Kubernetes and Docker. It consists of a web frontend, a redis master for storage and a replicated set of redis slaves.

### Step Zero: Prerequisites

This example assumes that you have forked the repository and [turned up a Kubernetes cluster](../../docs/getting-started-guides):

```shell
$ cd kubernetes
$ hack/dev-build-and-up.sh
```

### Step One: Turn up the redis master.

Use the file `examples/guestbook-go/redis-master-controller.json` to create a [replication controller](../../docs/replication-controller.md) which manages a single [pod](../../docs/pods.md). The pod runs a redis key-value server in a container. Using a replication controller is the preferred way to launch long-running pods, even for 1 replica, so the pod will benefit from self-healing mechanism in kubernetes.

Create the redis master replication controller in your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl` CLI:

```shell
$ kubectl create -f examples/guestbook-go/redis-master-controller.json
```

Once that's up you can list the replication controllers in the cluster:
```shell
$ kubectl get rc
CONTROLLER                             CONTAINER(S)            IMAGE(S)                            SELECTOR                     REPLICAS
redis-master-controller                redis-master            gurpartap/redis                     name=redis,role=master       1
```

List pods in cluster to verify the master is running. You'll see a single redis master pod. It will also display the machine that the pod is running on once it gets placed (may take up to thirty seconds).

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
POD                  IP           CONTAINER(S)   IMAGE(S)          HOST                                    LABELS                   STATUS    CREATED     MESSAGE
redis-master-y06lj   10.244.3.4                                    kubernetes-minion-bz1p/104.154.61.231   name=redis,role=master   Running   8 seconds   
                                  redis-master   gurpartap/redis                                                                    Running   3 seconds  
```

If you ssh to that machine, you can run `docker ps` to see the actual pod:

```shell
me@workstation$ gcloud compute ssh --zone us-central1-b kubernetes-minion-bz1p

me@kubernetes-minion-3:~$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                  COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS
d5c458dabe50        gurpartap/redis:latest                 "/usr/local/bin/redi   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes
```

(Note that initial `docker pull` may take a few minutes, depending on network conditions.)

### Step Two: Turn up the master service.
A Kubernetes '[service](../../docs/services.md)' is a named load balancer that proxies traffic to one or more containers. The services in a Kubernetes cluster are discoverable inside other containers via environment variables or DNS. Services find the containers to load balance based on pod labels.

The pod that you created in Step One has the label `name=redis` and `role=master`. The selector field of the service determines which pods will receive the traffic sent to the service.  Use the file `examples/guestbook-go/redis-master-service.json` to create the service in the `kubectl` cli:

```shell
$ kubectl create -f examples/guestbook-go/redis-master-service.json

$ kubectl get services
NAME           LABELS                   SELECTOR                 IP(S)         PORT(S)
redis-master   name=redis,role=master   name=redis,role=master   10.0.11.173   6379/TCP
```

This will cause all new pods to see the redis master apparently running on $REDIS_MASTER_SERVICE_HOST at port 6379, or running on 'redis-master:6379'. Once created, the service proxy on each node is configured to set up a proxy on the specified port (in this case port 6379).

### Step Three: Turn up the replicated slave pods.
Although the redis master is a single pod, the redis read slaves are a 'replicated' pod. In Kubernetes, a replication controller is responsible for managing multiple instances of a replicated pod.

Use the file `examples/guestbook-go/redis-slave-controller.json` to create the replication controller:

```shell
$ kubectl create -f examples/guestbook-go/redis-slave-controller.json

$ kubectl get rc
CONTROLLER     CONTAINER(S)   IMAGE(S)          SELECTOR                 REPLICAS
redis-master   redis-master   gurpartap/redis   name=redis,role=master   1
redis-slave    redis-slave    gurpartap/redis   name=redis,role=slave    2
```

The redis slave configures itself by looking for the redis-master service name:port pair. In particular, the redis slave is started with the following command:

```shell
redis-server --slaveof redis-master 6379
```

Once that's up you can list the pods in the cluster, to verify that the master and slaves are running:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
POD                  IP           CONTAINER(S)   IMAGE(S)          HOST                                     LABELS                   STATUS    CREATED      MESSAGE
redis-master-y06lj   10.244.3.4                                    kubernetes-minion-bz1p/104.154.61.231    name=redis,role=master   Running   5 minutes
                                  redis-master   gurpartap/redis                                                                     Running   5 minutes
redis-slave-3psic    10.244.0.4                                    kubernetes-minion-mluf/104.197.10.10     name=redis,role=slave    Running   38 seconds
                                  redis-slave    gurpartap/redis                                                                     Running   33 seconds
redis-slave-qtigf    10.244.2.4                                    kubernetes-minion-rcgd/130.211.122.180   name=redis,role=slave    Running   38 seconds
                                  redis-slave    gurpartap/redis                                                                     Running   36 seconds
```

You will see a single redis master pod and two redis slave pods.

### Step Four: Create the redis slave service.

Just like the master, we want to have a service to proxy connections to the read slaves. In this case, in addition to discovery, the slave service provides transparent load balancing to clients. The service specification for the slaves is in `examples/guestbook-go/redis-slave-service.json`

This time the selector for the service is `name=redis,role=slave`, because that identifies the pods running redis slaves. It may also be helpful to set labels on your service itself--as we've done here--to make it easy to locate them later.

Now that you have created the service specification, create it in your cluster with the `kubectl` CLI:

```shell
$ kubectl create -f examples/guestbook-go/redis-slave-service.json

$ kubectl get services
NAME           LABELS                   SELECTOR                 IP(S)         PORT(S)
redis-master   name=redis,role=master   name=redis,role=master   10.0.11.173   6379/TCP
redis-slave    name=redis,role=slave    name=redis,role=slave    10.0.234.24   6379/TCP
```

### Step Five: Create the guestbook pod.

This is a simple Go net/http ([negroni](https://github.com/codegangsta/negroni) based) server that is configured to talk to either the slave or master services depending on whether the request is a read or a write. It exposes a simple JSON interface, and serves a jQuery-Ajax based UX. Like the redis read slaves it is a replicated service instantiated by a replication controller.

The pod is described in the file `examples/guestbook-go/guestbook-controller.json`. Using this file, you can turn up your guestbook with:

```shell
$ kubectl create -f examples/guestbook-go/guestbook-controller.json

$ kubectl get replicationControllers
CONTROLLER     CONTAINER(S)   IMAGE(S)                  SELECTOR                 REPLICAS
guestbook      guestbook      kubernetes/guestbook:v2   name=guestbook           3
redis-master   redis-master   gurpartap/redis           name=redis,role=master   1
redis-slave    redis-slave    gurpartap/redis           name=redis,role=slave    2
```

Once that's up (it may take ten to thirty seconds to create the pods) you can list the pods in the cluster, to verify that the master, slaves and guestbook frontends are running:

```shell
POD                  IP           CONTAINER(S)   IMAGE(S)                  HOST                                     LABELS                   STATUS    CREATED      MESSAGE
guestbook-1xzms      10.244.1.6                                            kubernetes-minion-q6w5/23.236.54.97      name=guestbook           Running   40 seconds   
                                  guestbook      kubernetes/guestbook:v2                                                                     Running   35 seconds   
guestbook-9ksu4      10.244.0.5                                            kubernetes-minion-mluf/104.197.10.10     name=guestbook           Running   40 seconds   
                                  guestbook      kubernetes/guestbook:v2                                                                     Running   34 seconds   
guestbook-lycwm      10.244.1.7                                            kubernetes-minion-q6w5/23.236.54.97      name=guestbook           Running   40 seconds   
                                  guestbook      kubernetes/guestbook:v2                                                                     Running   35 seconds   
redis-master-y06lj   10.244.3.4                                            kubernetes-minion-bz1p/104.154.61.231    name=redis,role=master   Running   8 minutes    
                                  redis-master   gurpartap/redis                                                                             Running   8 minutes    
redis-slave-3psic    10.244.0.4                                            kubernetes-minion-mluf/104.197.10.10     name=redis,role=slave    Running   3 minutes    
                                  redis-slave    gurpartap/redis                                                                             Running   3 minutes    
redis-slave-qtigf    10.244.2.4                                            kubernetes-minion-rcgd/130.211.122.180   name=redis,role=slave    Running   3 minutes    
                                  redis-slave    gurpartap/redis                                                                             Running   3 minutes   
```

You will see a single redis master pod, two redis slaves, and three guestbook pods.

### Step Six: Create the guestbook service.

Just like the others, you want a service to group your guestbook pods.  The service specification for the guestbook is in `examples/guestbook-go/guestbook-service.json`.  There's a twist this time - because we want it to be externally visible, we set the `createExternalLoadBalancer` flag on the service.

```shell
$ kubectl create -f examples/guestbook-go/guestbook-service.json

$ kubectl get services
NAME           LABELS                   SELECTOR                 IP(S)          PORT(S)
guestbook      name=guestbook           name=guestbook           10.0.114.109   3000/TCP
redis-master   name=redis,role=master   name=redis,role=master   10.0.11.173    6379/TCP
redis-slave    name=redis,role=slave    name=redis,role=slave    10.0.234.24    6379/TCP
```

To play with the service itself, find the external IP of the load balancer:

```shell
$ kubectl get services guestbook -o template --template='{{(index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0).ip}}'
104.154.63.66$
```
and then visit port 3000 of that IP address e.g. `http://104.154.63.66:3000`.

**NOTE:** You may need to open the firewall for port 3000 using the [console][cloud-console] or the `gcloud` tool. The following command will allow traffic from any source to instances tagged `kubernetes-minion`:

```shell
$ gcloud compute firewall-rules create --allow=tcp:3000 --target-tags=kubernetes-minion kubernetes-minion-3000
```

If you are running Kubernetes locally, you can just visit http://localhost:3000
For details about limiting traffic to specific sources, see the [GCE firewall documentation][gce-firewall-docs].

[cloud-console]: https://console.developer.google.com
[gce-firewall-docs]: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#firewalls

### Step Seven: Cleanup

You should delete the service which will remove any associated resources that were created e.g. load balancers, forwarding rules and target pools. All the resources (replication controllers and service) can be deleted with a single command:
```shell
$ kubectl delete -f examples/guestbook-go
guestbook-controller
guestbook
redis-master-controller
redis-master
redis-slave-controller
redis-slave
```

To turn down a Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
$ cluster/kube-down.sh
```
