# NAME
kube-controller-manager \- Enforces kubernetes services.

# SYNOPSIS
**kube-controller-manager** [OPTIONS]

# DESCRIPTION

The **kubernetes** controller manager is really a service that is layered on top of the simple pod API. To enforce this layering, the logic for the replicationcontroller is actually broken out into another server. This server watches etcd for changes to replicationcontroller objects and then uses the public Kubernetes API to implement the replication algorithm.

The kube-controller-manager has several options.

# OPTIONS
*       **--address=127.0.0.1**: The IP address to serve on (set to 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)
*       **--allocate-node-cidrs=false**: Should CIDRs for Pods be allocated and set on the cloud provider.
*       **--alsologtostderr=false**: log to standard error as well as files
*       **--cloud-config=""**: The path to the cloud provider configuration file.  Empty string for no configuration file.
*       **--cloud-provider=""**: The provider for cloud services.  Empty string for no provider.
*       **--cluster-cidr=<nil>**: CIDR Range for Pods in cluster.
*       **--cluster-name="kubernetes"**: The instance prefix for the cluster
*       **--concurrent-endpoint-syncs=5**: The number of endpoint syncing operations that will be done concurrently. Larger number = faster endpoint updating, but more CPU (and network) load
*       **--concurrent-rc-syncs=5**: The number of replication controllers that are allowed to sync concurrently. Larger number = more reponsive replica management, but more CPU (and network) load
*       **--deleting-pods-burst=10**: Number of nodes on which pods are bursty deleted in case of node failure. For more details look into RateLimiter.
*       **--deleting-pods-qps=0.1**: Number of nodes per second on which pods are deleted in case of node failure.
*       **--httptest.serve=**: if non-empty, httptest.NewServer serves on this address and blocks
*       **--kubeconfig=""**: Path to kubeconfig file with authorization and master location information.
*       **--log-backtrace-at=**:0: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
*       **--log-dir=**: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
*       **--log-flush-frequency=5s**: Maximum number of seconds between log flushes
*       **--logtostderr=true**: log to standard error instead of files
*       **--master=""**: The address of the Kubernetes API server (overrides any value in kubeconfig)
*       **--namespace-sync-period=5m0s**: The period for syncing namespace life-cycle updates
*       **--node-monitor-grace-period=40s**: Amount of time which we allow running Node to be unresponsive before marking it unhealty. Must be N times more than kubelet's nodeStatusUpdateFrequency, where N means number of retries allowed for kubelet to post node status.
*       **--node-monitor-period=5s**: The period for syncing NodeStatus in NodeController.
*       **--node-startup-grace-period=1m0s**: Amount of time which we allow starting Node to be unresponsive before marking it unhealty.
*       **--node-sync-period=10s**: The period for syncing nodes from cloudprovider. Longer periods will result in fewer calls to cloud provider, but may delay addition of new nodes to cluster.
*       **--pod-eviction-timeout=5m0s**: The grace peroid for deleting pods on failed nodes.
*       **--port=10252**: The port that the controller-manager's http service runs on
*       **--profiling=true**: Enable profiling via web interface host:port/debug/pprof/
*       **--pvclaimbinder-sync-period=10s**: The period for syncing persistent volumes and persistent volume claims
*       **--register-retry-count=10**: The number of retries for initial node registration.  Retry interval equals node-sync-period.
*       **--resource-quota-sync-period=10s**: The period for syncing quota usage status in the system
*       **--root-ca-file=""**: If set, this root certificate authority will be included in service account's token secret. This must be a valid PEM-encoded CA bundle.
*       **--service-account-private-key-file=""**: Filename containing a PEM-encoded private RSA key used to sign service account tokens.
*       **--stderrthreshold=2**: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
*       **--v=0**: log level for V logs
*       **--version=false**: Print version information and quit
*       **--vmodule=**: comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging

# EXAMPLES
```
/usr/bin/kube-controller-manager --logtostderr=true --v=0 --master=127.0.0.1:8080
```
